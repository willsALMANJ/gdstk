Getting Started
###############

GDSII files contain a hierarchical representation of any polygonal geometry.
They are mainly used in the microelectronics industry for the design of mask layouts, but are also employed in other areas.

Because it is a hierarchical format, repeated structures, such as identical transistors, can be defined once and referenced multiple times in the layout, reducing the file size.

There is one important limitation in the GDSII format: it only supports `weakly simple polygons <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_polygon>`_, that is, polygons whose segments are allowed to intersect, but not cross.

In particular, curves and shapes with holes are *not* directly supported.
Holes can be defined, nonetheless, by connecting their boundary to the boundary of the enclosing shape.
In the case of curves, they must be approximated by a polygon.
The number of points in the polygonal approximation can be increased to better approximate the original curve up to some acceptable error.

The original GDSII format limits the number of vertices in a polygon to 199.
This limit seems arbitrary, as the maximal number of vertices that can be stored in a GDSII record is 8190.
Nonetheless, most modern software disregard both limits and allow an arbitrary number of points per polygon.
Gdstk follows the modern version of GDSII, but this is an important issue to keep in mind if the generated file is to be used in older systems.

The units used to represent shapes in the GDSII format are defined by the user.
The default unit in Gdstk is 1 µm (10⁻⁶ m), but that can be easily changed by the user.

******************
First GDSII Layout
******************

Let's create our first GDSII file:

.. code-block:: python

   import gdstk

   # The GDSII file is called a library, which contains multiple cells.
   lib = gdstk.Library()

   # Geometry must be placed in cells.
   cell = lib.new_cell('FIRST')

   # Create the geometry (a single rectangle) and add it to the cell.
   rect = gdstk.rectangle((0, 0), (2, 1))
   cell.add(rect)

   # Save the library in a file called 'first.gds'.
   lib.write_gds('first.gds')

   # Optionally, save an image of the cell as SVG.
   cell.write_svg('first.svg')

After importing the ``gdstk`` module, we create a library ``lib`` to hold the design.

All layout elements must be added to cells, which can be though of pieces of papers where the geometry is drawn.
Later, a cell can reference others to build hierarchical designs, as if stamping the referenced cell into the first, as we'll see in :ref:`references`.

We create a :class:`gdstk.Cell` with name "FIRST" (cells are identified by name, therefore cell names must be unique within a library) and add a :func:`gdstk.rectangle` to it.

Finally, the whole library is saved in a file called "first.gds" in the current directory.
The GDSII file can be opened in a number of viewers and editors, such as `KLayout <https://klayout.de/>`_.


********
Polygons
********

General polygons can be defined by an ordered list of vertices.
The orientation of the vertices (clockwise/counter-clockwise) is not important: they will be ordered internally.

   :align: center


Holes
=====

As mentioned in :ref:`getting-started`, holes have to be connected to the outer boundary of the polygon, as in the following example:

.. literalinclude:: tutorial_images.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Holes
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/holes.*
   :align: center


Circles
=======

The :func:`gdstk.ellipse` function creates circles, ellipses, doughnuts, arcs and slices.
In all cases, the argument ``tolerance`` will control the number of vertices used to approximate the curved shapes.

When saving a library with :meth:`gdstk.Library.write_gds`, if the number of vertices in the polygon is larger than ``max_points`` (199 by default), it will be fractured in many smaller polygons with at most ``max_points`` vertices each.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial_images.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Circles
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/circles.*
   :align: center


Curves
======

Constructing complex polygons by manually listing all vertices in :class:`gdstk.Polygon` can be challenging.
The class :class:`gdstk.Curve` can be used to facilitate the creation of polygons by drawing their shapes step-by-step.
The syntax is inspired by the `SVG path specification <https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html>`_.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial_images.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Curves
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/curves.*
   :align: center

Coordinate pairs can be given as a complex number: real and imaginary parts are used as x and y coordinates, respectively.
That is useful to define points in polar coordinates.

Elliptical arcs have syntax similar to :func:`gdstk.ellipse`, but they allow for an extra rotation of the major axis of the ellipse.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial_images.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Curves 1
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/curves_1.*
   :align: center

Curves sections can be constructed as cubic, quadratic and general-degree Bézier curves.
Additionally, a smooth interpolating curve can be calculated with the method :meth:`gdstk.Curve.interpolation`, which has a number of arguments to control the shape of the curve.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial_images.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Curves 2
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/curves_2.*
   :align: center

Transformations
===============

All polygons can be transformed trough :meth:`gdstk.Polygon.translate`, :meth:`gdstk.Polygon.rotate`, :meth:`gdstk.Polygon.scale`, and :meth:`gdstk.Polygon.mirror`.
The transformations are applied in-place, i.e., no new polygons are created.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial_images.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Transformations
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/transformations.*
   :align: center


Layer and Datatype
==================

All shapes in the GDSII format are tagged with 2 properties: layer and data type (or text type in the case of :class:`gdstk.Label`).
They are always 0 by default, but can be any integer in the range from 0 to 255.

These properties have no predefined meaning.
It is up to the system using the GDSII file to chose with to do with those tags.
For example, in the CMOS fabrication process, each layer could represent a different lithography level.

In the example below, a single file stores different fabrication masks in separate layer and data type configurations.
Python dictionaries are used to simplify the assignment to each polygon.


.. literalinclude:: tutorial_images.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Layer and Datatype
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/layer_and_datatype.*
   :align: center

.. _references:

**********
References
**********

References are responsible for the hierarchical structure of the layout.
Through references, the cell content can be reused in another cell (without actually copying the whole geometry).
As an example, imagine the we are designing an electronic circuit that uses hundreds of transistors, all with the same shape.
We can draw the transistor just once and reference it throughout the circuit, rotating or mirroring each instance as necessary.

Besides creating single references, it is also possible to create full 2D arrays with a single entity, both using :class:`gdstk.Reference`.
Both uses are exemplified below.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial_images.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: References
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/references.*
   :align: center


*****
Paths
*****

Besides polygons, the GDSII format defines paths, witch are `polygonal chains <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonal_chain>`_ with associated width and end caps.
The width is a single number, constant throughout the path, and the end caps can be flush, round, or extended by a custom distance.

There is no specification for the joins between adjacent segments, so it is up to the system using the GDSII file to specify those.
Usually the joins are straight extensions of the path boundaries up to some beveling limit.
Gdstk also uses this specification for the joins.

It is possible to circumvent all of the above limitations within Gdstk by storing paths as polygons in the GDSII file.
The disadvantage of this solution is that other software will not be able to edit the geometry as paths, since that information is lost.

The construction of paths (either GDSII paths or polygonal paths) in Gdstk is based on :class:`gdstk.FlexPath` and :class:`gdstk.RobustPath`.


Flexible Paths
==============

The class :class:`gdstk.FlexPath` is a mirror of :class:`gdstk.Curve` before, with additional features to facilitate path creation:

- all curve construction methods are available;
- path width can be easily controlled throughout the path;
- end caps and joins can be specified by the user;
- straight segments can be automatically joined by circular arcs;
- multiple parallel paths can be designed simultaneously;
- spacing between parallel paths is arbitrary - the user specifies the offset of each path individually.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial_images.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Flexible Paths
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/flexible_paths.*
   :align: center

The corner type 'circular bend' (together with the `bend_radius` argument) can be used to automatically curve the path.
This feature is used in :ref:`example-integrated-photonics`.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial_images.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Flexible Paths 1
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/flexible_paths_2.*
   :align: center

Width and offset variations are possible throughout the path.
Changes are linearly tapered in the path section they are defined.
Note that, because width changes are not possible for GDSII paths, they will be stored as polygonal objects.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial_images.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Flexible Paths 2
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/flexible_paths_3.*
   :align: center


Robust Paths
============

In some situations, :class:`gdstk.FlexPath` is unable to properly calculate all the joins.
This often happens when the width or offset of the path is relatively large with respect to the length of the segments being joined.
Curves that meet other curves or segments at sharp angles are a typical example where this often happens.

The class :class:`gdstk.RobustPath` can be used in such scenarios where curved sections are expected to meet at sharp angles.
The drawbacks of using :class:`gdstk.RobustPath` are the extra computational resources required to calculate all joins and the impossibility of specifying joins.
The advantages are, as mentioned earlier, more robustness when generating the final geometry, and freedom to use custom functions to parameterize the widths or offsets of the paths.

.. literalinclude:: tutorial_images.py
   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Robust Paths
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/robust_paths.*
   :align: center

Note that, analogously to :class:`gdstk.FlexPath`, :class:`gdstk.RobustPath` can be stored as a GDSII path as long as its width is kept constant.


****
Text
****

In the context of a GDSII file, text is supported in the form of labels, which are ASCII annotations placed somewhere in the geometry of a given cell.
Similar to polygons, labels are tagged with layer and text type values (text type is the label equivalent of the polygon data type).
They are supported by the class :class:`gdstk.Label`.

Additionally, Gdstk offers the possibility of creating text as polygons to be included with the geometry.
The function :func:`gdstk.text` creates polygonal text that can be used in the same way as any other polygons in Gdstk.
The font used to render the characters contains only horizontal and vertical edges, which is important for some laser writing systems.

*******************
Geometry Operations
*******************

Gdstk offers a number of functions and methods to modify existing geometry.
The most useful operations include :func:`gdstk.boolean`, :func:`gdstk.slice`, :func:`gdstk.offset`, and :meth:`gdstk.Polygon.fillet`.


Boolean Operations
==================

Boolean operations (:func:`gdstk.boolean`) can be performed on polygons, paths and whole cells.
Four operations are defined: union ("or"), intersection ("and"), subtraction ("not"), and symmetric difference ("xor").
They can be computationally expensive, so it is usually advisable to avoid using boolean operations whenever possible.
If they are necessary, keeping the number of vertices is all polygons as low as possible also helps.

   :start-after: Boolean Operations
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/boolean_operations.*
   :align: center


Slice Operation
===============

As the name indicates, a slice operation subdivides a set of polygons along horizontal or vertical cut lines.

   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Slice Operation
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/slice_operation.*
   :align: center


Offset Operation
================

The function :func:`gdstk.offset` dilates or erodes polygons by a fixed amount.
It can operate on individual polygons or sets of them, in which case it may be necessary to set ``use_union = True`` to remove the impact of inner edges.
The same is valid for polygons with holes.

   :language: python
   :dedent: 4
   :start-after: Offset Operation
   :end-before: draw

.. image:: _static/tutorial/offset_operation.*
   :align: center


Fillet Operation
================

The method :meth:`gdstk.Polygon.fillet` can be used to round polygon corners.

*************
GDSII Library
*************

All the information used to create a GDSII file is kept within an instance of :class:`gdstk.Library`.
Besides all the geometric and hierarchical information, this class also holds a name and the units for all entities.
The name can be any ASCII string — it is simply stored in the GDSII file and has no other purpose in Gdstk.
The units require some attention because they can impact the resolution of the polygons in the library when written to a file.

.. _units-in-gds:

Units in GDSII
==============

Two values are defined when creating a :class:`gdstk.Library`: ``unit`` and ``precision``.
The value of ``unit`` defines the unit size—in meters—for all entities in the library.
For example, if ``unit = 1e-6`` (10⁻⁶ m, the default value), a vertex at (1, 2) should be interpreted as a vertex in real world position (1 × 10⁻⁶ m, 2 × 10⁻⁶ m).
If ``unit`` changes to 0.001, then that same vertex would be located (in real world coordinates) at (0.001 m, 0.002 m), or (1 mm, 2 mm).

The value of precision has to do with the type used to store coordinates in the GDSII file: signed 4-byte integers.
Because of that, a finer coordinate grid than 1 ``unit`` is usually desired to define coordinates.
That grid is defined, in meters, by ``precision``, which defaults to ``1e-9`` (10⁻⁹ m).
When the GDSII file is written, all vertices are snapped to the grid defined by ``precision``.
For example, for the default values of ``unit`` and ``precision``, a vertex at (1.0512, 0.0001) represents real world coordinates (1.0512 × 10⁻⁶ m, 0.0001 × 10⁻⁶ m), or (1051.2 × 10⁻⁹ m, 0.1 × 10⁻⁹ m), which will be rounded to integers: (1051 × 10⁻⁹ m, 0 × 10⁻⁹ m), or (1.051 × 10⁻⁶ m, 0 × 10⁻⁶ m).
The actual coordinate values written in the GDSII file will be the integers (1051, 0).
By reducing the value of ``precision`` from 10⁻⁹ m to 10⁻¹² m, for example, the coordinates will have 3 additional decimal places of precision, so the stored values would be (1051200, 100).

The downside of increasing the number of decimal places in the file is reducing the range of coordinates that can be stored (in real world units).
That is because the range of coordinate values that can be written in the file are [-(2³²); 2³¹ - 1] = [-2,147,483,648; 2,147,483,647].
For the default ``precsision``, this range is [-2.147483648 m; 2.147483647 m].
If ``precision`` is set to 10⁻¹² m, the same range is reduced by 1000 times: [-2.147483648 mm; 2.147483647 mm].


Saving a GDSII File
===================

To save a GDSII file, simply use the :meth:`gdstk.Library.write_gds` method, as in the :ref:`first-gdsii`.

An SVG image from a specific cell can also be exported through :meth:`gdstk.Cell.write_svg`, which was also demonstrated in :ref:`first-gdsii`.


Loading a GDSII File
====================

The function :func:`gdstk.read_gds` loads an existing GDSII file into a new instance of :class:`gdstk.Library`.

.. code-block:: python

   # Load a GDSII file into a new library
   lib1 = gdstk.read_gds("filename.gds")

   # Load the same file, but convert all units to nm
   lib2 = gdstk.read_gds("filename.gds", 1e-9)

Access to the cells in the loaded library is provided through the list :attr:`gdstk.Library.cells`.
The method :meth:`gdstk.Library.top_level` can be used to find the top-level cells in the library (cells on the top of the hierarchy, i.e., cell that are not referenced by any other cells).

Raw Cells
=========

Library loaded using the previous method have all their elements interpreted and re-created by Gdstk.
This can be time-consuming for large layouts.
If the reason for loading a file is simply to re-use it's cells without any modifications, the function :func:`gdstk.read_rawcells` is much more efficient.

.. code-block:: python

   # Load all cells from a GDSII file without creating the actual geometry
   cells = gdstk.read_rawcells("filename.gds")

   # Use some loaded cell in the current design
   my_ref = gdstk.Reference(cells["SOME_CELL"], (0, 0))

Note that the units are not changed in this process, so the current design must use the same ``unit`` and ``precision`` as the loaded cells.
